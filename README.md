In Simon's Game, players must replicate a sequence of colors by clicking the corresponding buttons in the correct order.

## How to Play
1. The game consists of four colored buttons: green, red, yellow, and blue.
2. The game starts by displaying a random pattern of colors, which the player needs to remember.
3. The player must then repeat the pattern by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
4. If the player successfully reproduces the pattern, the game adds an additional step to the pattern.
5. The game continues to increase the length of the pattern as the player progresses.
6. If the player makes a mistake and fails to replicate the pattern correctly, the game ends.
7. The player's goal is to reach the highest possible level and achieve a high score.
